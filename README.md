# Hi, I'm Todd Balwinski

I am a rising third year engineering student at the University of Virginia where I major in Computer Science with minors in Business and Data Science. I enjoy improving processes and workflows using technology and build my own to implement when I can. 

Please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect!
