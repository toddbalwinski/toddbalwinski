## Hi, I'm Todd Balwinski

I am a rising third year engineering student at the University of Virginia where I major in Computer Science with minors in Business and Data Science. I enjoy improving processes and workflows using technology and build my own to implement when I can. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect!

What I am currently working on:

While functional I am still working on my Golf Pool that I run. I have future features for both the entry form and the scoring sheet and also a long term vision to create an entire site with history and all of the scoring logic coded in instead of in sheets.

I also have plans to build a website for Trigon Engineering Society to give the society an internet presence as well as to help streamline the recruitment process.
